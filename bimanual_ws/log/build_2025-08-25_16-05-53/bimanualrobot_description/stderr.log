  By not providing "Findurdf_tutorial.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "urdf_tutorial"

    urdf_tutorial-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "urdf_tutorial" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "urdf_tutorial_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "urdf_tutorial" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
